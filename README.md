## Getting Started

### Installation

We recommend running data-ops with `npx`. Be aware that npx calls the cached version of the tool. Use @latest to ensure you're using the latest version.


```bash
npx @kontent-ai/data-ops@latest <command>
```

Alternatively, you can install the package globally or locally:

```bash
# Global installation
npm install -g @kontent-ai/data-ops

# Local installation
npm install @kontent-ai/data-ops
```

**Use `-h` or `--help` anytime to get information about available commands and their options.**

```bash
npx @kontent-ai/data-ops@latest --help
# or
yarn dlx @kontent-ai/data-ops --help

# Help for a specific command
npx @kontent-ai/data-ops@latest <command> --help

# If installed globally
data-ops --help
```


### Configuration

All options (including options for commands) can be provided in three different ways:

- **As command-line parameters** (e.g., `--environmentId xxx`)
- **In a JSON configuration file** (e.g., `--configFile params.json`) - *We recommend this approach*
- **As environment variables** with `DATA_OPS_` prefix and transformed into UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `DATA_OPS_ENVIRONMENT_ID=xxx npx @kontent-ai/data-ops ...`)


## Commands

The tool usage is based on commands provided in the following format:

```bash
npx @kontent-ai/data-ops@latest <command-name> <command-options>
```

Below are the available commands:

- **[import & export](./src/commands/importExport/README.md)**: Import or export data to and from a Kontent.ai project.
- **[clean](./src/commands/clean/README.md)**: Delete data in your Kontent.ai environment.
- **sync-model**:
  - **[export](./src/commands/syncModel/export/README.md)**: Export the content model of an environment.
  - **[diff](./src/commands/syncModel/diff/README.md)**: Compare content models between environments.
  - **[run](./src/commands/syncModel/run/README.md)**: Synchronize content models between environments.
- **sync-content**:
  - **[export](./src/commands/syncContent/export/README.md)**: Export selected content items and assets.
  - **[run](./src/commands/syncContent/run/README.md)**: Synchronize content items between environments.
- **[migrations](./src/commands/migrations/README.md)**:
  - **add**: Add new migration scripts.
  - **run**: Execute migration scripts.

> [!NOTE]: All command functions are publicly exposed, making it easy to include them in your scripts. See the individual command readmes for more information.

### Including and Excluding Entities in Commands

Certain data-ops commands (import, export, clean) support the `--include` and `--exclude` options. These options allow you to specify which entities you want the command to process, giving you fine-grained control over the operation.

#### Available Entities

You can include or exclude the following entities using the `--include` and `--exclude` options:

- **`collections`**: Collections in your project used to organize content items into logical groups.
- **`spaces`**: Spaces within your project define different target (preview) applications.
- **`taxonomies`**: Taxonomy groups used for categorizing and tagging content.
- **`languages`**: Languages configured for your project to support localization.
- **`previewUrls`**: Preview URLs set up for content types to enable content previews.
- **`roles`**: User roles that define permissions and access levels within the project.
- **`workflows`**: Workflows that outline the stages of content creation and publication.
- **`contentTypeSnippets`**: Reusable groups of elements (snippets) that can be included in multiple content types.
- **`contentTypes`**: Definitions of content types that specify the structure and elements of content items.
- **`contentItems`**: Individual content items created in your project.
- **`languageVariants`**: Variants of content items in different languages.
- **`assetFolders`**: Folders used to organize assets within the asset library.
- **`assets`**: Media files such as images, videos, and documents stored in your project.
- **`webhooks`**: Webhooks configured to notify external services of events occurring in your project.
- **`webSpotlight`**: Web Spotlight configurations for visual website content editing.

#### Usage

- **Including Specific Entities**: Use the `--include` option followed by a list of entities you want to include in the command's operation.
- **Excluding Specific Entities**: Use the `--exclude` option followed by a list of entities you want to exclude from the command's operation.

#### Examples

**Including Only Content Items and Assets in an Export**

```bash
npx @kontent-ai/data-ops@latest export \
  --environmentId <environment-id> \
  --apiKey <Management-API-key> \
  --include contentItems assets
```

**Excluding Roles and Workflows from an Export**

```bash
npx @kontent-ai/data-ops@latest export \
  --environmentId <environment-id> \
  --apiKey <Management-API-key> \
  --exclude roles workflows
```

**Cleaning an Environment Excluding Taxonomies and Languages**

```bash
npx @kontent-ai/data-ops@latest clean \
  --environmentId <environment-id> \
  --apiKey <Management-API-key> \
  --exclude taxonomies languages
```

**Synchronizing Content Types and Snippets Only**

```bash
npx @kontent-ai/data-ops@latest sync-model run \
  --sourceEnvironmentId <source-environment-id> \
  --sourceApiKey <source-api-key> \
  --targetEnvironmentId <target-environment-id> \
  --targetApiKey <target-api-key> \
  --entities contentTypes contentTypeSnippets
```

#### Tips

- **Selective Operations**: Use the `--include` option when you want to operate on a limited set of entities.
- **Configuration Files**: For complex commands with multiple entities, consider using a configuration file with the `--configFile` option to manage your parameters more easily.

---

By understanding and utilizing the `--include` and `--exclude` options, you can tailor the data-ops tool commands to fit your specific needs, ensuring efficient and effective management of your Kontent.ai projects, however, you have to be aware of dependent entities when using these options.

### Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/kontent-ai/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

### Getting Started with Development

- Run `npm ci` to install packages.
- Run `npm run build` to compile the tool.
- Run `node build/src/index.js --help` to run (or `npm run start -- --help`).

### Running Tests

We have comprehensive test suites to ensure the reliability of the Data Ops tool.

- **Unit Tests**: Run `npm run test:unit` to execute unit tests.
- **Integration Tests**: Run `npm run test:integration` to execute integration tests.

  > [!IMPORTANT]: Integration tests require access to a Kontent.ai project and may create temporary environments. Interrupting tests may lead to orphaned environments. Always allow tests to complete or clean up manually if necessary.

- > [!IMPORTANT]: Run `npm run test:advancedDiff` to compare generated advanced diffs with test baselines.

### Prepare Your Testing Project

To successfully execute integration tests, you need to prepare a Kontent.ai project with corresponding environments. You can use the [import](./src/commands/importExport/README.md) command to import prepared zip files located at `tests/integration/<testName>/data/<zipName>.zip`.

#### Exporting Test Environments

All Kontent.ai test environments are exported in `tests/integration/<testName>/data/<zipName>.zip`. When you update any of these environments, you should also update the corresponding exported zip files. To streamline this process, we've provided a script called `exportTestEnvironments.js`. You can run it with the command `npm run export:testEnv`. If you need to export specific environments, you can use the following command parameters: `-i` for Import/Export test environment, `-s` for Sync Source Template environment, and `-t` for Sync Target Template environment. For instance, to export only the Sync Source and Sync Target environments, you would run `npm run export:testEnv -- -s -t`.

> [!IMPORTANT]: Creation and removal of new environments takes some time; therefore, try to keep the number of environment-dependent tests to a minimum.

### Configuration for Testing

The configuration is only necessary to run the integration tests.

- Copy the `.env.template` into `.env`:

  ```bash
  cp .env.template .env
  ```

- Fill in the values (each value is explained in comments in the template).

### Repository Structure

The main part of the tool is located in the `src` folder. The project is structured around commands, with each command defined on the [yargs](https://yargs.js.org/) object in a folder of the same name within the `src/commands` folder. The exported `register` function (of type `RegisterCommand`) must be included in `src/index.ts` in the `commandsToRegister` array.

Tests can be found in `tests/integration` and `tests/unit` folders. Integration tests require Kontent.ai environments and a valid Management API key for successful execution. You can use the `withTestEnvironment` function to provide the tests with a new empty environment.
